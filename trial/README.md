#### Main Project Files Located in directory => Backbone

- This project uses Backbone, Backbone.LocalStorage, and Marionette for the JavaScript development
- I am comfortable enough with these tools that I understand how they work and use them.
- I did orignially attempt with Angular but have not had as much training on it and opted to put my best foot forward.

- I have structured the code acording to MV* patterns where logic is seperated into Collections, Models, and Views
- The collections handles "talking" with the API's or DB available before sending each record to an individual Model
- The model and collections are then tied to a view that can be updated with the current data.
